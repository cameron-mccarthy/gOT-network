      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
         gOT Network is a network enumeration tool developed with the goal of increasing visibility within operational technology networking environments.
         Operational technology network environments often have low visibility stemming from a variety of criteria, including the type of devices on the network, obtuse network topologies, and a lack of logging.
         This lack of visibility can lead to non compliant patch management, configuration oversights, and potential vulnerabilities.
         The gOT Network seeks to help improve this issue of network visibility by connecting to the network and noninvasively collecting available data.
         Utilizing simple network management protocol with compatible devices such as routers and switches we can query them for their ARP and MAC tables.
         Using this gathered information we can help to provide a clearer idea of what all a network has to offer.
         Packaging the final result for IT staff members, they can choose the best course of action when it comes to hardening their network.

        <h3>Frontend</h3>
          <p>
            The frontend is a locally hosted website built by using <strong>Angular</strong>. It utilizes many Angular libraries for functionality, such as the <strong>core</strong> and <strong>material</strong> libraries, to display the information gathered from the backend.
          </p>
      <br>
        <h3>Backend</h3>
          <p>
            The backend uses <strong>easysnmp</strong> to query routers for their ARP tables to aquire a device's MAC and IP address.
            This information is stored in a locally hosted <strong>SQLite</strong> database.
            Using <strong>Flask</strong>, a device's information is sent to the <strong>Angular</strong> website to be displayed and edited using <strong>HTTP requests</strong>.

        <figcaption>
          The <strong>Scan Button</strong> allows devices to automatically be added to the table by adding devices from a networking device's <strong>ARP table</strong>.

        <figcaption>
          When the scan button is clicked, a dialog box will appear to insert information for the scan.<br>
          First, insert the networking device's <strong>IP address</strong> and choose which <strong>SNMP version</strong> to use. <br>
          After choosing the SNMP version, more information will be required based on the SNMP version selected.
